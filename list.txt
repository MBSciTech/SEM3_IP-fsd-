Here‚Äôs a list of **9 simple and commonly used chemistry formulas** that you can use to create calculators:  

### **1. Molarity (M) Calculator**  
\[
M = \frac{n}{V}
\]
- **M** = Molarity (mol/L)  
- **n** = Moles of solute (mol)  
- **V** = Volume of solution (L)  

---

### **2. Dilution Formula Calculator**  
\[
M_1 V_1 = M_2 V_2
\]
- **M‚ÇÅ, V‚ÇÅ** = Initial molarity and volume  
- **M‚ÇÇ, V‚ÇÇ** = Final molarity and volume  

---

### **3. Density Calculator**  
\[
\rho = \frac{m}{V}
\]
- **œÅ (Density)** = g/mL or g/cm¬≥  
- **m (Mass)** = g  
- **V (Volume)** = mL or cm¬≥  

---

### **4. Ideal Gas Law Calculator**  
\[
PV = nRT
\]
- **P (Pressure)** = atm  
- **V (Volume)** = L  
- **n (Moles of gas)**  
- **R (Gas constant)** = 0.0821 L¬∑atm/mol¬∑K  
- **T (Temperature)** = K

### **5. pH Calculator**  
\[
pH = -\log [H^+]
\]
- **[H‚Å∫]** = Hydrogen ion concentration (mol/L)  

---

### **6. Percent Composition Calculator**  
\[
\% \text{Composition} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of element}}{\text{Total mass of compound}} \right) \times 100
\]
- **Mass of element** = g  
- **Total mass of compound** = g  

---

### **7. Molecular Weight Calculator**  
\[
\text{Molecular Weight} = \sum (\text{Atomic Mass} \times \text{Number of Atoms})
\]
- Sum up atomic masses from the periodic table  

---

### **8. Empirical Formula Calculator**  
1. Convert % composition to grams  
2. Convert grams to moles  
3. Divide by the smallest number of moles  
4. Get the simplest whole-number ratio  

---

### **9. Boiling Point Elevation Calculator**  
\[
\Delta T_b = i K_b m
\]
- **ŒîT_b** = Boiling point elevation  
- **i** = Van't Hoff factor  
- **K_b** = Boiling point elevation constant  
- **m** = Molality (mol/kg)  

---

These formulas cover **solutions, gases, acids/bases, and thermodynamics**, making them useful for chemistry students.
